Yo Daniel:

I'm having a really hard time in Section 4 Lecture 15 'Modify the Credit Card Form'

After I add the JS code minute 2:31 in the mentioned above section. My app stops rendering the stripe form period.

Before adding the JS, the CC form renders fine. I'm enclosing Github repos of the project.

Prior to adding the JS: https://github.com/scubaxx/iloveseaurchin

I noticed that your tutorial doesn't include '@import "bootstrap-sprockets";' in the file bootstrap_custom.css.scss

Please help me, I'm including these two repos so that you can see the dependencies and versions included in my project.

Thanks in advance man!

Mauricio
